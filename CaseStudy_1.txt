Not answering Question wise(1 and 2 separate),rather compressing as a whole--
Since,the users are mostly of blue collared/low income category people,the few possible reasons for credit card company to incur losses-
1)They don't transact enough ,so their initial debts dont get cleared.
 Possible solutions-Suppose,give those credit cards a special bonus--i.e discount on goods bought from merchants(Slightly lessen ur
processing fees,and invest those money in the merchants->discount to the credit card user).It will increase the number of transactions,
and hence chance of redeem the past interests/debts by the issuing bank.

2)Constancy in number of users-
No of users need to be increased.In such a situation,u can offer them Rs X points on Y successful(implies the referred person makes payment,
to some extent like Dream11) referrals.
     In the above point as given,these points will be redeemable once they maintain(don't cross) a certain unpaid limits.However,upper limit
must not be lessened as it would lead to One time users.

3)For Various other startups/sponsors(Example-utensils,low cost city-gold company who wants to increase their users),u can advertise them(I 
mean,gift an user with X+ numbers of credit card transactions).

4)Sell the highly loss making accounts to the  debt acquiring companies.(Its very less feasible,as the users don't have much asset)


5)Momentarily,reduce the interest on debts.
